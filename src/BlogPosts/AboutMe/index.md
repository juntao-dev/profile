# About Me

This post is about myself, my interests and motivations.

**New Journey**

I discovered my strong passion in coding when I started learning Python on my own. I remember that strange feeling like I found a new way to look at the world around me. Trivial as the functions I wrote might be, the excitment was a long lasting one.

I wanted to keep digging. There was just so much I could explore and build with this new interest, so much so that I decided to step outside my comfort zone in the financial service industry and pursue a degree in information technology.

I am glad that I made that decision!

Yes, it felt intimidating at times and there were moments when I doubted myself. It is never quite the same when I watched other programmers talk about road blocks in their journey, until I found myself spending days trying to debug what was simply hidden in plain sight. Of course, that is learning.

**University Life**

Looking back, the degree did show me the many doors that are out there. I wanted to explore before committing myself into any particularly paths. That would tell you why I have elected units in different areas, covering UX, Web Dev, Mobile App Dev, REST API, Data Warehousing and Network Security. I was given the advise that Network Security would be a challenging unit as we needed to set up and protect a private network in one assignment and then make attempts to attack it in the next. It was a nice little suprise when I receive the letter saying that I achieved the highest grade in that unit that year.

With my friends, I often joke about the value of our degrees. How much we are paying as an international student to have the chance to learn on our own ways to complete the assignments at hand. One of my lecturer even mentioned in her first lecture that she would only point the direction and we are expected to start running on our own. I am in no position to say if that is the best teaching approach for everyone, but I learnt to think independently and be ready to teach myself what is needed to clear the 'road blocks'. Personally, this is a far more valuable lesson.

We had to work in teams in many of our assignments. Part of my degree also requried me to work in an agile one simulating industry experience. Having road blocks to clear is one thing, having to communicate and work with a team mate who might have a very different problem solving appraoch and even project objects could be totally different category of challenges. Sometimes we were able to find good compromise and gain great results. More often than not, though, we had to decide on a particular approach and contribute our best. It is all about communication. I have learnt and now truly believe that it is good communication skills that steer a team project from a total mess to one that utilises the strength of everyone in the team and delivers. Another important lesson.

**Career Start**

Now that I am in the position of stepping into the industry and making job applications, I am looking forward to finding one that I can apply my skills. More importantly, thought, I am looking for a place where I would have the opportunity to keep on learning new things. I realise that there is a gap between what were were taught back in university and what are expected by many employers. Self learning React and other front-end framework has helped me become a much more confident candiate. The learning process itself led me to even more doors - Functional Programming, TypeScript, Git, Webpack, Design Patterns, etc.

There is much to look forward to!
