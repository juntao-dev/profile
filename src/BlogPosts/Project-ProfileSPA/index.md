This is a casual working note for my profile site project, covering the journey I walked to build it, mixed with my exploration thoughts on any new things that I come across.

It has been a few months since I started learning React. I figure it is now time to apply some of the things that I have picked up and build up this personal profile project.

**Idea**

It is going to be a single page application implemented with React. Routing tasks are handled by react-router. The key sections of my profile site would inclue:

- Landing: Cover and Social Media Contacts
- Profile: Similar to that of a CV block, my background information
- Projects: Outline and description of projects that I have worked on (such as this one) and future project ideas
- Blog: Updates of my learning and career development

**Challenges**

- CSS has not been my strenght in the past. In fact, thanks to the many tools (e.g. Bootstrap) available out there, I was able to complete most of my university assignments without paying too much attention to styling. This time, though, I decided to style mysite myself with styled-component. Grid has been very nice to use to arrange the layout. The goal here is to create a website that is reponsive to screen size change.

- I have also considered the different tools that I could use to add in new features to this project. At some point I realised that this might not be a good way to do it. The real purpose of a personal profile site doesn't require it. For all the additional libraries, I'm going to just leave them to the other projects.

**Development Notes**
